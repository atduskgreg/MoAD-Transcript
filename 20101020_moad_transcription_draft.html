<p class="p1"><b>But this next part is about learning HOW when you're faced with having this in your office all day, and by now do in a very exciting sense.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How do you put that to work for yourself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How do you organize your files?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What kind of things do you do?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, to get going from this let's switch away from the tool down here and talk about some of the general features of the program and get back to the nature of RUC. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Let me get back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is another file.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this file I prepared a chain of views.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Using a set of tools I have it all set from one scene to another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could study them in the fashion I've shown you before but it's sort of fun to set up these chains and it represents to you a way in which we work too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To do it, I'm going to freeze a statement named "A" and I'm going to put on a certain parameter when I do it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I'll jump to a link, here's a link.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You want to go to statement A, but after the colon all this garbage tells a bunch of abbreviated ways in which you'd like to control the view when you get there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any parameters, so I'll go to that one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm looking at statement A.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So now it's telling me this presentation is devoted to the AHRIC.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ah ha! <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>There's another boo boo I made, I left several statements frozen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This statement, I've asked to be frozen, that was the set up operation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's just going to stay there above that dotted line as the viewing part of my screen from there down, and comes around in the links I have set up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ok, the first jump took me to this statement saying, I augmented the human intellect research center which is what HIRSC stands for.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A hidden link will take me to the next one, tell me where it's located.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In FRI it's an explicated entity that we call a group level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But also I'd like to point out that there's other non-computer work going on at SRI and ours is but one. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So if I jump on a link incidently I should just stop and reveal to you that the link is hidden under there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's very clever to set up the viewing parameters so that it doesn't show the link but when I say "jump to link" and mark it there the computer goes looking from there on for that link and obeys it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>And I'm not showing the statement names either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But this is a statement named P obviously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So that program involves about 17 people together with a special laboratory facilities we have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's sponsored by government agencies, specifically ARCO, NASA. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the past .... these are the people that first many years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's been a goal and pursuit for many years and I think we can just go off with a quick little picture I sketched to show, this is the staffing over the years from 1950 on and it's had quite a bumpy history.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During these years, there was only one of us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>[Crowd laughing.]<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I go back to where I was and say "let's continue on in this file", that links put me out to a different file to a statement to that view. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just back to this file where I was and within this file I can link to author to say HRIC is pursuing these goals to improve effectiveness within individuals and organizations that work at intellectual tasks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Better solutions, faster solutions, solutions to more complex problems, better use of human capabilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Really thinking about that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But a corollary goal, besides improving effectiveness, is to develop a system orientated discipline who are designing the means by which creator effectiveness is achieved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's very important to us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The approach to this should result in a system oriented discipline. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Let me just show you how I constructed this file.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There's a link hidden here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Back to this view that has slightly different view parameters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Get it out here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There's another one hidden here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The demo approach for us is critical in pursuing this monstrous goal that's monstrously difficult.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By building and trying empirically, we're approaching it evolutionary wise because we feel that it's a whole system problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You need to get a person in that environment working and looking at the many aspects of his working system that are involved in his effectiveness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Plus many more things than just these computerated tools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a large system like that you need to do it evolutionary wise because we can't be analytic about it enough at any one point to decide what best our next thing should be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We can only decide from here as well as we can analyze it where we can invest our next resources to get the most return at an increase to the effectiveness to the system we have. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>And this item down here, is the term bootstrapping applied. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Applying that to our approach, saying "We need a research subject group to give them these tools, put them to work and study them and improve them."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We'll do that by making ourselves be the subject group and studying ourselves and making the tools so that they improve our ability to develop and study these kinds of systems and to produce in the end this kind of system discipline. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>So it's a struggle doing it that way, but it's beginning to pay off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>... tools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In pursuing those goals one of our principle tools is this computer aid system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let's talk about it as a system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There's a link sequence to jump in there too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We'll talk about MLS in the online system, a very general term. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's been the NLS for many many years, an online system that evolved. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Right now we consider it to be primarily an online system or vehicle for helping humans to operate within the domain of complex information structures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, what do we mean by operate?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, suppose study modify is the place we started now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We know there are many things we can do but we want to get around study and modify.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To reach further information about "what does complex structure mean?" we're talking about a complex structure, an emphasizing structure because we say, "although the content represents your concepts, it's the structural relationship between that content entity that should represent the relationship between the concepts of human thought." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>All right we never can do that very well with linear text.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So inside the computer we can represent that quite well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, we can represent information structures in a computer that will generally be far too complex for you to study directly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But NRS serves as a tool to roam overlap and navigate through a complex structure to be able to find your way and navigate and move about it rapidly to be able to see what you want to see at any given point.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's how we take NRS as a tool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All right these are all very important concepts to us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These together with the boot strapping tell us where to start. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We start by building an instrument that we can sit at and work at during our day to organize the kind of working information that we need as a task force to developing systems. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need to write our specifications, our plans, our programs, our user's guides, our documentation, our reports, and even our proposals. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>So, we've been using these.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me return and talk to you about control techniques.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Control devices, control dialogue and control metal language that we're using. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Ok to talk about control devices, we'll use this overhead camera shot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you can see the devices that I'm using, I use three and they're not all standard. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have a pointing device called a "mouse", a standard keyboard and a special piece that we have here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We're trying to go for a picture down in our laboratory in Menlo park and pipe it up that'll show you from another point of view more about how that mouse works. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Come in Menlo park ... ok there'sDon Andrew's hand in Menlo Park.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And in a second we'll see the screen that he's working and the way the tracking spot moves in conjunction with movements of that mouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't know why we call it a mouse, sometimes I apologize.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It started that way and we never did change it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All right, if it moves up or down or sideways so does the tracking spot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the pencil for it's operation is pretty easy to see, "Can you turn it over Don?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Can you hear me Don?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would you turn it over and we'll see it right?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's principle is there are two wheels that roll along the surface.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since we have right angles and kind of sharp edges, one will roll and the other will slide in one direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each of these wheels control the potentiometer, the voltage output, sample ADD converter, the numbers taken in by the computer, sample times of the horizontal/vertical conforms are to be of where it should put the tracking spot. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>And as the mouse moves over the surface, then each of those wheels either slide sideways without rolling, or roles an amount that is very close to what people take to predict a component or horizontal or vertical motion it makes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All right, usually you have some close trajectory back to the same point. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Usually the tracking spot won't come back exactly the same place as it was on the screen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And for that sense it wouldn't work well if you're trying to trace a map or other figures into that diagram. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the way we use it continuously and conclusively is to watch the screen and to follow it around and to use that device to use that tracking spot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You're eying the tracking spot, and you really don't care whether it follows this exactly or not. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>In fact, we've had it at times where our tracking device we had to move in an arc like that to make a spot, the tracking spot go in a horizontal line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And people adjusted to it and would go like that to go in a straight line and they wouldn't even know they were doing it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This device over here we always have to justify and explain it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We'll do it in reverse order, we'll explain it first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>[Laughs.] <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It provides for you one hand equivalent of what you can do with a keyboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are five keys, and normally each finger sits on a key.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And pressing any one key at a time produces a character.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And any two keys at a time also.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And in fact, any combination of pressing, of which there are 31 combinations. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So Don can learn and type them out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So the way I've been going to reach this file, Bill is responsible for the design of all of our hardware, there's an outline he made of the way the controllers work for the IO controlling. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Now, from this line to the right, the things we added to a conventional SDS 940 system, and this is a swapping drum it's got two buses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both accessing to four,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>16 banks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The CPU has one bus and the peripheral equivalent has another and the good work of project Jeanie at Berkley on our whole project that evolved 940 time sharing hardware and software, produced a very neat priority system on this bus such that it can say "I'll defer my access to a given bank until the CPU doesn't want it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>"I'll defer it once or twice, or three times but then I really need it, so give me priority."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So that way this bank can slip in many many access to these while the CPU is hoping from bank to bank in it's successive accesses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We've taken advantage of that to put all of our control out here, a large 96 billion character disk for giving back up storage for ourselves. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are two display systems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each of which drives six displays and all of which are refreshed out of core.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the input controller which samples the keyboards, the keycepts, the mic of each session about 15 times a second and our printer and the network coupling here all fit into that same priority basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So they can all be working full built, and we find we get very low interference in CPU cycles being interrupted or interfered with something like the ratio, maybe one to one and a half percent here that it can't get when it wants to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may be running fifty, sixty, seventy percent of the available memory cycles that it can handle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All right? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>The control is stuck at intercore without ever interfering with the CPUs' process or interrupting the time sharing system if there's something no one says "hey take care of this user."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the display system reads out a core from a pre-structure like sort of links to cycle itself automatically and take all of that material, output it to a display something like 15 times a second, without any interference from CPU requirements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All right? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Let me talk to you about the display systems, the other aspect of the things that loop holes on here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's slightly unusual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For that I would like to switch to Menlo Park and get a view from the camera there, an actual look at the hardware.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So these are the units that develop the displays.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The computer constructs it right on a small high resolution CRT which we're focusing in on right now and in fact that's the CRT whose camera on the right we're looking at is generating the text view that's being piped down here on my console.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So those are faded in and out between the two so you can just sort of compare them. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>So that's very nice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There's my mouse moving around in Menlo Park, my tracking spot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So our displays work with those being watched by commercial cameras, look at my black book [laughs.]<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Commercial TV cameras, 8759 scanning rate is a fairly high resolution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Look at that, from there on out to the display station, the standard video microwave system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And if we back up the camera shot a bit, we'll see that we have a whole rack full of equipment here serving twelve of them which you notice, quite a lack of cameras mounted on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We seem to have stolen them all for the show [laughs.]<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So we only have seven consoles that work right now because the cameras are mounted to give you different special views. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>A few advantages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We use this particular display system hardware technique pretty much as an expediency for an experimental system we have available.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We originally were going to build stories to display in here but we couldn't get that delivered a year and a half ago when we had to firm up our design.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So we, as an expediency went to this brand we've been developing very nice video stuff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were kind enough to show us all these controllers and work with video.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So we went with a very simple brute force way of having video signals generated by having a small CRT.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well it turns out that that little CRT and it's incremental cost, the video camera, the controller, and a monitor totaled about fifty five hundred dollars which is cheaper than most fairly good resolution deflection display and monitors so it came out well in the price of the hardware. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Turns out also that the cathode of a camera tube and uh ... just black and white usage like this can back off the scanning current of it so that the sticky capsule, so that it doesn't erase the image on it by each sweep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It can take 3 or 4 scans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So with something like a 15 cycle a second on the CRT's the camera, the one that's generating this as well as the one that we looked at a few minutes ago have short term stories in there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's quite different from long persistence but gives us the flicker free display here and the flicker free display there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This lets us use that display generation hardware for three to four times as many display stations as otherwise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You'll notice if we get just the text alone that there's a small effect in smearing but it's not that bad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that comes from the memory in the ... ok so much for that. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>I'd like now to Jeff Willison from Menlo Park he's sitting at his console working independently. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hi Jeff! <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p class="p1"><b>Jeff:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, I was just gonna look at that Doug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Uh ... as I was sifting down through that I was sort of not only moving through the file but the structure of the code is made in such a way that is a description of a finite state machine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so I was following the characters a person would type to execute that command.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Down here underneath it I see that the routine is QMW over in the overlay text edit. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So let's go back to that other file, move back to our picture again and find where overlay text edit is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So right down here, we'll move down through that one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The text edit overlay illustrates a lot of the different kinds of things that we've done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This file has two major kinds of code in it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First one is many of the these special languages that we've built up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>See I'm trying to find "QMW."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Uh ... down here someplace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There we go!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Uh .. let's see.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two kinds of code.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let's just see the type from the other file.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The QMW routine, the first ... the second routine it called is "move word", the word delimiter, I'm sorry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This routine is written in our content analysis language.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And uh ... it takes a text string and finds the definition of a word.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its a file for punctuation and it finds any special points around it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It finds pointers that describe that word.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another interesting one is the "next" routine here, look at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's in another special language that we built up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It takes the pointers left over from the delimiter routine and the text in the file and reconstructs the statement after the edit's been done. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Let's see ... where was I in this file?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Uh ... another portion of the file is written in a language we call MOL.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That stands for machine oriented language.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The MOL is a, in a sense it's a high level language in that it has structure and control constructs like in this statement and in all statements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's also very very close to machine language, 940 machine language.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People talk about the actual registers of the machine and you talk about doing indirect addressing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This language has helped us write the type of fast type code that we want, that we have to have to operate this time sharing system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the same time, it's given us a lot of flexibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Uh ... it's also the very structure of the MOL designed to sort of mesh with the log structure of NOL NLS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have a "while" statement to see what's in that "while" statement I can move down to see it's statement, which is an "if" statement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The "if" statement is a single "if" statement that has an "if" and an "else" part.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That whole block opens up all of that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So by using the MOL I'm able to move around very quickly in my MOL files. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Also able to sort of zoom in and out of things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the ... besides the program organizational benefits we get from designing all of the special purpose languages, we've been able to design the syntax of these languages so that they fit with our linking structure and the conventions we've set up and the aid we built to help us and then they move around between them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the ways we've managed to implement all of these languages is by designing a compiler compiler which we call TREMETTA.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of our compilers<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are written in Tremetta.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'd like to add that we're very thankful to some people at the development corporation for helping us get started on a lot of the notions on Tremetta, Erwin Book and Val Shorey [sp?] it's invaluable for helping us get started. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By having all of our compilers written in a high level languages themselves, we've been able to change them all the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We're finally able to quickly modify the syntax of the control language for analysis itself with the meanings of the commands by working in a high level language.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We're also able to pull in and just change the compilers as quickly as we have to, to accommodate all sorts of new hardware features and extremiting that we do like that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More notes that programmers leave around about ? things that are wrong with our system right now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I've got my blank line off, how did I?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, one of the interesting things that NLS does, just an advantage of being online is that it keeps track of who you are and what you're doing all the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So on these statements, uh ... on everything, every statement that you write it keeps track of who you are and when you did it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>So not only can people leave notes around for each other but it's sort of automated aid here that tells us who did it and when they did it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can set up search patterns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think these will probably be talked about later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So that sort of summarizes what the thing looks like and how it's put together. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p class="p1"><b>So this language here in it's hierarchical structure resembling the branching tree of choices you the user makes specifying at every point what the computer does in feedback and the optional choices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And down in the end in specifying the actual function like deleting a word, what's a word?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And what do you mean by "delete"?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And for what the word is specified in the subroutine he showed you, in a special language to find in there what a word is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it doesn't take a lot of programing skills to learn how to read these languages because they're at the concept level almost where the user wants to work. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

<p class="p1"><b>Joint file usage is something that is very powerful here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I went up to a file that we were working on as we were getting ready in the early part of this presentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a message, something that three of us used a lot between us to coordinate the planning and path, contingency plan, special needs for ball joint [sp?] <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We developed a message technique, so we could leave messages for each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under there, usage conventions, and let me just tell you about that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Underneath here the direct messages to each other we can unfold and see.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many times you didn't want direct messages as much as you just like to go through and leave a message for somebody. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>So we worked off the conventions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here's an example [chuckles.]<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The convention we're going to use is that we would send a message to WK BCE [sp?] message I would put that in the file.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>WKE and BCE with a pound sign in between.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So any statement that's marked like that means there's a message to him from me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I want to, I can say it's also for Dave Evans, like that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So that's from me to both of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have this thing we call a constant panel [sp?] as Jeff mentioned briefly, in which we can write expressions in a language.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let's just come down here and look ....</b></p>

<p class="p1"><b>Bill:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Key words in associative reordering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm in use of terms from a specified vocabulary to describe what it is that you're after.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps the best way to show this would be just to draw a little picture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A key word can be selected from a list.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We'll put the list over here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can have any number of key words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'll just put down CAT to see where it is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>oops.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I spelled that one wrong. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Doug:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You need any help?</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bill:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah, how do you spell "catalog"?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There it is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is that close enough?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There'll be several items in the catalog. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What we want to do with them is select things out of this catalog. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Doug:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What do the "R's" stand for?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bill:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those are the numbers used just like serial numbers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's the Dewey decimal system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>[Laughs]</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Doug:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You mean reference 3, reference N? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bill:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then the "K" I guess needs to be a K word. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Doug:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's fine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bill:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The key word will point to various items in the catalog.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So the first key word, we point to those and the NP word will point to other ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And there will be cases where they both point to the same one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I select a key word, I'm specifying that all of the items in the catalogue get referred to will be pulled out, given to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And in the cases where I've selected several key words that refer to one particular item, that item will be given special preference and will be put at the head of the list.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And with that list of items from the catalogue, I'll be able to use the other forms of retrieval and jump off and look at the items.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then I can continue the exploration. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>So now I'm able to select the key words that I want to use to describe what I'm interested in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can do that just by pointing at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it writes the word up here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And another "accept" to accept it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can hit "file control" and I've already accepted file referencing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm able to [background noise: "hello"] we're still on?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Doug:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, we hear you. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bill:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somebody hung up on us. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Doug: [laughing.]<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How do you say "go ahead" with the mouse?</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bill:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We're on?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>[Audience laughing]</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>So I selected several key words here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can go ahead and give particular key words greater weight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The weighting refers to how important that key word is in describing what I'm after.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I can give this one a weight of two, whereas this one previously will just have a weight of one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That means that the item being referred to by this key word, earlier in the selection when we're finished.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let's go ahead now and say "key word execute" and this'll go off and get the items out of the catalogue and re-order them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And here we have the results.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now I have, I can use these to jump to various places in the file. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm still in the systems file.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The item here is the name of the utility. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I can jump and get the information about that utility in the file. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Doug:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well ... [interrupting]</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bill:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And find out various things about it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Doug:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can you hear me?</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bill:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Go back to the previous view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And now if I want to go off and get the previous information, I link on this and here I have the documentation on that procedure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After looking at that I can go back again and now I'm set up again to go and continue looking. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can look at the next item and here I've got the results on hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I can continue to proceed in this way looking at the various documentation and going back and continue to explore, re-specify the search parameters and look at new key words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well Doug, I don't know if you survived through that?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had the operator, the telephone company hung up on us I think half way through, you still back on? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Doug:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I guess we better come back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm sorry I can't say goodbye to Bill. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bill:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can hear you now! <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>[Audience laughing]</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Doug:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh! <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bill:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You been talking all this time? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>[Audience laughing]</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Doug:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I saw when you leaned over and hung up the phone for awhile so I couldn't interrupt you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>[Chuckles.]<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well I'm sorry we're pushed when we're trying to describe each of the features in this system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This particular one, the key word is very powerful and could very well warrant a whole session, a whole paper on itself because this is the power of key word descriptor organization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But with the added feature of giving weight to the key word so the results of the search as you see right here are ordered so that this one ended up needed the most requirements, and most weight and down here could be one that only was associated with one of the descriptors in the lowest weight one at that. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>So you have an ordered list that's probably relevant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then right where it says "all links" you use that as a link to go off to the file to find it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a directory of the set of procedures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So this ... here's a list of procedures for those key words he chose that all describe certain things about file handling and this will take you off into the actual source code.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I go now, he's wrote them all. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Bill: [laughs]</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Doug:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are his files.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name of the place in his files, and the view that you should open up so that when you follow this on a jump to link you just see a single overall view of that procedure. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>And then as he pointed out, instead of saying "jump to link" you jump to a name in this file where these things have descriptive material about that too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, I think for the software guy it's very powerful and thanks very much Bill. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>All right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other few things we're going to talk about very quickly are the range of activities underneath in our program. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will just go very quickly through these then.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A service system development and user system development we'll talk about those a bit, only requires me to establish a distinction between those two kinds of system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We've taken to splitting the overall computer system into this dichotomy of these two systems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The service system is what appears at the terminal when I push this button, I get that response, when I do this I get that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's the repertoire of commands in the services [chuckles] and organization of software and hardware and sometimes people give to me. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>The user system is what's beyond that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Give that, what can I do with it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What kind of conventions for leaving messages is for using the content analyzer and for organizing our files and how do we use the links and the key word thing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>User system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And this is kind of a new element in systems research that we're trying to establish and we can integrate that kind of user system where the people's methods, the concepts they use, the procedures, the skills all are developed in the coordination with the kind of tools that they have. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Within our ???? we also have an explicit activity they call management system where we're taking some project money and developing our own set of management tools to help us manage 17 people and all these diverse activities in this complex system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so we are beginning to develop some of those, and we'd be happy to talk to you about those in our open house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A forthcoming involvement is this ???? computer network.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Experimental network that's going to come and end up being in it's first form in about a year and end up in some time later with some 20 experimental computers in a network.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I hope they'll be able to transmit across the country. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bandwidth is something like 20 kilohertz per second.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Delay times of less than a tenth of a second.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should be enough so that I could be running a system in Cambridge over the network and getting the same kind of response on a CRT. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>And it may be that the people there, the next time we have a conference in Boston, I'll try this from there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Within that network we're going to try to develop a special service to provide network information, relevant network information for people, for the kind of information it takes to operate such a network.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who's got what services for protocol?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How do I get there?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who's up today?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How much do I use the user's guide?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where can I find the paper that describes this system that so and so offers? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>That's going to be very challenging for us to utilize our tools for organizing and retrieving information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The last thing here is just a little comment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all of this what's the product that we're providing in this research?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, we're providing a sample augmentation system, the one we use. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only that it's an augmentation system, but it's provided to augment computer system development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And beyond that, we also hope that we're developing quite a few design principles for developing augmentation systems and these I hope are transferable things. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
