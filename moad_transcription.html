 THE CAPTURING ON FILM OF THE AUDIO
AND VIDEO WAS A PROCESS SUBSIDIARY TO
THE PRESENTATION, AND THE LATTER WAS
NOT STOPPED FOR THE TWO TIMES WHEN THE
MOVIE-CAMERA OPERATOR HAD TO LOAD
FRESH FILM -- CONSEQUENTLY, THERE ARE
NOTICEABLE GAPS BETWEEN REELS [OF THE
ORDER OF A MINUTE].

  SIGNALS FROM AUXILIARY TELEVISION
CAMERAS WERE SOMETIMES SWITCHED TO THE
PROJECTOR -- THE OPENING SCENE IS FROM
SUCH A CAMERA, SHOWING ENGLEBART'S
FACE VIEW, JUST AFTER HE WAS
INTRODUCED.
