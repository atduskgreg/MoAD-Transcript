        THE CAPTURING ON FILM OF THE AUDIO
        AND VIDEO WAS A PROCESS SUBSIDIARY TO
        THE PRESENTATION, AND THE LATTER WAS
        NOT STOPPED FOR THE TWO TIMES WHEN THE
        MOVIE-CAMERA OPERATOR HAD TO LOAD
        FRESH FILM -- CONSEQUENTLY, THERE ARE
        NOTICEABLE GAPS BETWEEN REELS [OF THE
        ORDER OF A MINUTE].
        SIGNALS FROM AUXILIARY TELEVISION
        CAMERAS WERE SOMETIMES SWITCHED TO THE
        PROJECTOR -- THE OPENING SCENE IS FROM
        SUCH A CAMERA, SHOWING ENGLEBART'S
        FACE VIEW, JUST AFTER HE WAS
        INTRODUCED.
